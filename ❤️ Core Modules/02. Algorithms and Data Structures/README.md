- [ ]  Know what is algorithm time complexity
- [ ]  Applied these concepts to searching and sorting algorithms

### **Data structures**:
For each of the data structures listed below, you have to understand their functionality, including common operations and their time complexities; what are their strengths and their limitations and, finally, how they are used in real-world scenarios.

- [ ]  Arrays
  - [ ] Traversing, Searching, Insertion, Deletion, Size
- [ ]  Stacks
  - [ ]  Push, Pop, is empty, top

## **Algorithms Applications & theory**

 <h2>Algorithm</h2> 

noun, UK  /Àà√¶l.…°…ô.r…™.√∞…ôm/ US  /Àà√¶l.…°…ô.r…™.√∞…ôm/

>a process, step-by-step procedure or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output, especially by a computer, and those can be simple processes, such as multiplying two numbers, or a complex operation, such as playing  compressed video file. or a Search engine that uses proprietary algorithms to display the most relevant results from its search index for specific queries.


**<small>Cambridge dictionary/ Oxford Languages</small>**
</div>

- **What:** Algorithms are a part of daily life actions, and those daily actions and everything we do is the simplest form to represent what an Algorithm is, e.g Finding you car in a parking lot , cleaning your Apartment, reading a book.
  
  ---



- **Applications**: The real power of Algorithms come in form of Digital tools, Softwares or small computer programs like, Compression algorithms in a 3D video game or Searching algorithms in Google Search engine, or sorting algorithms to sort Amazon's products based on their ratings and all the other services and digital tools that you use on daily bases.

  ___

- **Efficiency**: Not all algorithms are created equal, and the tricky part of an Algorithm is that there are plenty of algorithms that solve the same problem at the end, but one of them is the most efficint one to use in that spesific problem case, so to know which solution to choose and to be able to compare them, these Algorithms most be analyzed, and before before analyuzing there an important thing that you need to know what makes a good algorithm is the two most important criteria which are that it solves a problem and it does so efficintly.

    ---
- **Measuring Efficiency**: so the way we measure the effecincy of an algorithm is through using a scientific mathematical technique called **```Asymptotic analysis```**, which allows algorithms to be compared independently of a particular programming language or hardware, whci will next tell us that some algorithms are  more efficient than others.
