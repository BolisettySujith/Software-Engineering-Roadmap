  ## **What's a Clean Code?**
  
  </div>

  Clean Code is a readable, understandable and scalable code that any developer other than the original author can read, maintain and change easily, a code that can be adapted to changing requirements and with understandability comes readability, changeability, extensibility and maintainability.

  ---

  and of the things that a Clean Code is certinaly not is not a code that (**just works**)
  and Martin Fowler & Uncle Bob describes clean code in one of the places:

  > Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. (<small>Martin Fowler</small>)

  >What derives us to make the mess in the first place in software development is (The desire to go fast) (<small>Uncle Bob</small>)
  <br>

<br>

## **What's not a Clean code**

a code that grows more and more disorganized as it is changed over time, leading to slower and slower development,
and that's why it's crucial to master how to write Clean Code as a Software engineer.

## **Learning Checklist ‚úÖ**

<details>
  <summary>A handy checklist to keep track of your progress, and know when you master your Clean code path üíà. <b>Click to expand</b></summary>
</br>

A list of the things we're going to learn üî•

- [ ]  Modularity
- [ ]  SOLID Principles
- [ ]  Interfaces in general, characteristics of clean interfaces
- [ ]  YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
- [ ]  Principle of least astonishment

Characteristics of high-quality code:

- [ ]  Good identifier names
- [ ]  Good functions: size, arguments, return values
- [ ]  Error handling and exceptions
- [ ]  Appropriate use of data types

How to recognize and write high-quality data structures, classes, and interfaces, leveraging the following concepts as appropriate:
  - [ ]  Encapsulation and information hiding
  - [ ]  Internal cohesion and external coupling
  - [ ]  Inheritance and composition
  - [ ]  Dependency inversion

Mastering:
- [ ]  know the characteristics of high-quality code
- [ ]  how to practically write code that has high quality
- [ ]  how to recognize potential quality issues (‚Äúbad smells‚Äù)
- [ ]  how to improve code quality by refactoring
- [ ]  knowledge and are able to use it in practice.

## **Characteristics of a Clean code**:

</br>

<details>
<summary>Characteristics of a Clean code | <b>Click to expand</b></summary>

<br>

Aside from all the steps and to summerize (Treat your code like an essay an you are it's author) and that's what is going to lean to building a readable and understable code üòâ

  ---
#### 1. It should be elegant readable and meaningful
   -  Clean code should be pleasing to read. Reading it should make you smile the way a well-crafted music box or well-designed car would.

#### 2. Should avoid unintiuitive names, complex nesting, and big code blocks.
  
#### 3. Clean code is focused
   -  Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.
#### 4. Clean code is taken care of.
   - Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared.

#### 5. Runs all the tests
   - You know your code is dirty when only 95% of your tests passed. You know you‚Äôre screwed when you test coverage is 0%.

#### 6. Clean code is easier and cheaper to maintain!


#### 7. Contains no duplication and reduces cognitive load
   - Each time you have to make a change in a duplicate code, you have to remember to make the same change to every instance. This increases the cognitive load and slows down the progress, so Minimize the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.

#### 8. Minimize the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.
  - Less code is less stuff to keep in your head. Less code is less maintenance. Less code is fewer bugs. Code is liability, keep it short and simple.


#### 9. Should follow common best practices and patterns.
