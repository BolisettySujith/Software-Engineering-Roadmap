## **What is Git Version Control system & What is Github üòÉ**

<details>
  <summary>Let's first get to know GIT üìá | <b>Click to expand</b></summary>
</br>
Version control system is an incredibly important part of a professional developer's life. and in this guide, you'll learn about the benefits of version control system and install add Git and Github to your tool belt üòâ! 

![Linus Trvoalds](https://media.giphy.com/media/xndHaRIcvge5y/giphy.gif)
<!-- ![Linus Trvoalds](https://i.imgflip.com/e4gzh.jpg) -->
But aside from all of that Git is a free¬†[open source](https://github.com/git/git) software written by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) who also wrote the Linux operating system's kernel. Git is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in programming as¬†version control. If you've used a track changes feature in a text editing software then you're already familiar with the concept!

___
<br/>

### **Version control models: Centralized vs. Decentralized**

There are a number of Version Control Systems out there. This alone should prove that version control is incredibly important. Three of the most popular version control systems are:

- Git
- Subversion
- Mercurial

and there are many version control systems out there. Often they are divided into two groups: ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù and ‚Äúdistributed‚Äù.

### **Centralized**:

Centralized version control systems are based on the idea that there is a single ‚Äúcentral‚Äù copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server), and developers will ‚Äúcommit‚Äù their changes to this central copy.
### **Decentralized**:

In the past five years or so a new breed of tools has appeared: so-called ‚Äúdistributed‚Äù version control systems (DVCS for short). The three most popular of these are Mercurial, Git and Bazaar.

These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project‚Äôs files. Instead, every developer ‚Äúclones‚Äù a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This copy (or ‚Äúclone‚Äù) has all of the metadata of the original.

This method may sound wasteful, but in practice, it‚Äôs not a problem. Most programming projects consist mostly of plain text files (and maybe a few images), and disk space is so cheap that storing many copies of a file doesn‚Äôt create a noticable dent in a hard drive‚Äôs free space. Modern systems also compress the files to use even less space.

<br/>

> **Recap**: 
> Version control systems aim to solve a specific problem that developers face: ‚Äústoring and sharing multiple versions of code files.‚Äù If you‚Äôre a developer of any kind and you don‚Äôt use any kind of version control, you should start right now. It will make your life easier, so the main point of a version control system is to help you maintain a detailed history of the project as well as the ability to work on different versions of it. Having a detailed history of a project is important because it lets you see the progress of the project over time. If needed, you can also jump back to any point in the project to recover data or files.

## **Git Terminology**

<details >
<summary>How about we familiarize ourselves with Git's jargons, and break this fragile fear wall üí™üèΩ | <b>Click to expand</b></summary>
</br>
Git is a tool that covered vast terminology and jargon, which can often be difficult for new users, or those who know Git basics but want to become Git masters. So, we need a little explanation of the terminology behind the tools. Let's have a look at the commonly used terms.

---
<br/>

</center>
<br/>
<br/>

### 1. **Git**:

an SCM (and therefore a VCS!). The URL for the Git website is https://git-scm.com/ (see how it has "SCM" directly in its domain!).

---
<br/><br/>

![Branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/distributed.png)

### 2. **VCS version Control System / Source Code Manager**:
<br/>



A version control system (abbreviated as VCS) is a tool that manages different versions of source code. A source code manager (abbreviated as SCM) is another name for a version control system.

---

<br/><br/>

![](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/lifecycle.png)

### 3. **Commit**:
<br/>



Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Every time you commit (save the state of your project in Git), it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. You can think of it as a save point in a game - it saves your project's files and any information about them.

Everything you do in Git is to help you make commits, so a commit is the fundamental unit in Git.

---
<br/><br/>

![](https://git-scm.com/images/branching-illustration@2x.png)

### 4. **Repository / repo**:

A repository is a directory which contains your project work, as well as a few files (hidden by default on Mac OS X) which are used to communicate with Git. Repositories can exist either locally on your computer or as a remote copy on another computer. A repository is made up of commits and in Git, Repository is like a data structure used by VCS to store metadata for a set of files and directories. It contains the collection of the file as well as the history of changes made to those files. Repositories in Git is considered as your project folder. A repository has all the project-related data. Distinct projects have distinct repositories.



---
<br/>


![git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png)

### 5. **Working Directory**:
<br/>

The Working Directory is the files that you see in your computer's file system. When you open your project files up on a code editor, you're working with files in the Working Directory.

This is in contrast to the files that have been saved (in commits!) in the repository.

When working with Git, the Working Directory is also different from the command line's concept of the current working directory which is the directory that your shell is "looking at" right now.

---
<br/>


### 6. **SHA**:

A SHA is basically an ID number for each commit. Here's what a commit's SHA might look like: e2adf8ae3e2e4ed40add75cc44cf9d0a869afeb6.

It is a 40-character string composed of characters (0‚Äì9 and a‚Äìf) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git. "SHA" is shorthand for "Secure Hash Algorithm". If you're interested in learning about hashes, check out our Intro to Computer Science course.

</br></br>

![Branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/checkout-master.png)

### 7. **Branch**:



A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It is an essential feature available in most modern version control systems.Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project, and a Git project can have more than one branch. We can perform many operations on Git branch-like rename, list, delete, etc.



---
<br/><br/>

![](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/basic-branching-3.png)

### 8. **Checkout**:


A checkout is when content in the repository has been copied to the Working Directory, and it is used for the act of switching between different versions of a target entity and simly the git checkout command is used to switch between branches in a repository.


---

<br/><br/>

### 9. **Cherry-Picking**:
Cherry-picking in Git is meant to apply some commit from one branch into another branch. In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch. You can revert the commit and cherry-pick it on another branch, git cherry-pick is a useful tool but not always a best practice. Cherry picking can cause duplicate commits and many scenarios where cherry picking would work, traditional merges are preferred instead. With that said git cherry-pick is a handy tool for a few scenarios.

---

<br/><br/>



![](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/basic-merging-2.png)

### 10. **Merge**:

Merging is a process to put a forked history back together. The git merge command facilitates you to take the data created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.


---

<br/><br/>

![](https://git-scm.com/images/about/index1@2x.png)

### 11. **Staging Area / Staging Index / Index**:
<br/>


<br/>

The Git index is a staging area between the working directory and repository. It is used as the index to build up a set of changes that you want to commit together and in a simler way it's a file in the Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit. You can think of the staging area as a prep table where Git will take the next commit. Files on the Staging Index are poised to be added to the repository, which means when we use ``` git add ``` which will get to know what that is later, it adds files to the staging area, form the stage of the working directory, and when we ```git commit``` those added changes it adds them to the repository.


---

<br/>

### 12. **Pull/Pull Request**:
The term Pull is used to receive data from remote git servers e.g Gitlab, GitHub... It fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory. The git pull command is used to make a Git pull.

Pull requests are a process for a developer to notify team members that they have made a feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their remote server account. Pull request announces all the team members that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch, Pull requests are features that makes it easier for developers to collaborate using Git servers like Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab. They provide a user-friendly web interface for discussing proposed changes before integrating them into the official project.




---

<br/>

### 13. **Push**:
The push term refers to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is an act of transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository. Pushing is capable of overwriting changes; caution should be taken when pushing.


---

<br/>

### 14. **Upstream And Downstream**:
The term upstream and downstream refers to the repository. Generally, upstream is from where you clone the repository, and downstream is any project that integrates your work with other works. However, these terms are not restricted to Git repositories.

There are two different contexts in Git for upstream/downstream, which are remotes and time/history. In the reference of remote upstream/downstream, the downstream repo will be pulled from the upstream repository. Data will flow downstream naturally.

In the reference of time/history, it can be unclear, because upstream in time means downstream in history, and vice-versa. So it is better if we use the parent/child terms in place of upstream/downstream in case of time/history.




---

<br/>


### 15. **Fetch**:

It is used to fetch branches and tags from one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their histories. It updates the remote-tracking branches.




---

<br/>

### 16. **Git Reset**:

The term reset stands for undoing changes. The git reset command is used to reset the changes. The git reset command has three core forms of invocation. These forms are as follows.

- Soft
- Mixed
- Hard

If we say in terms of Git, then Git is a tool that resets the current state of HEAD to a specified state. It is a sophisticated and versatile tool for undoing changes. It acts as a time machine for Git. You can jump up and forth between the various commits. Each of these reset variations affects specific trees that git uses to handle your file in its content.

Additionally, git reset can operate on whole commits objects or at an individual file level. Each of these reset variations affects specific trees that git uses to handle your file and its contents.


---

<br/>

### 17. **Git Diff**:
Git diff is a command-line utility. It's a multiuse Git command. When it is executed, it runs a diff function on Git data sources. These data sources can be files, branches, commits, and more. It is used to show changes between commits, commit, and working tree, etc.

It compares the different versions of data sources. The version control system stands for working with a modified version of files. So, the diff command is a useful tool for working with Git.

However, we can also track the changes with the help of git log command with option -p. The git log command will also work as a git diff command.



---

<br/>

### 18. **Git Fork**:
A fork is a rough copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project. One of the excessive use of forking is to propose changes for bug fixing. To resolve an issue for a bug that you found, you can:

- Fork the repository.
- Make the fix.
- Forward a pull request to the project owner.

Forking is not a Git function; it is a feature of Git service like GitHub.



---

<br/>


### 19. **Git Clone**:
In Git, cloning is the act of making a copy of any target repository. The target repository can be remote or local. You can clone your repository from the remote repository to create a local copy on your system. Also, you can sync between the two locations.



---

<br/>


### 20. **Git Remote**:
In Git, the term remote is concerned with the remote repository. It is a shared repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. A remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like an internal server, GitHub, Subversion and more.

In case of a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state, as an alternative it only consists of the .git versioning data.




---

<br/>


### 21. **HEAD**:

HEAD is the representation of the last commit in the current checkout branch. We can think of the head like a current branch. When you switch branches with git checkout, the HEAD revision changes, and points the new branch.

---

<br/>

### 22. **Master**:

Master is a naming convention for Git branch. It's a default branch of Git. After cloning a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository contains only a single local branch. This branch is called a "master" branch. It means that "master" is a repository's "default" branch.


---

<br/>

### 23. **Git Revert**:

In Git, the term revert is used to revert some changes. The git revert command is used to apply revert operation. It is an undo type command. However, it is not a traditional undo alternative. It does not delete any data in this process; instead, it will create a new change with the opposite effect and thereby undo the specified commit. Generally, git revert is a commit.

It can be useful for tracking bugs in the project. If you want to remove something from history then git revert is a wrong choice.

Moreover, we can say that git revert records some new changes that are just opposite to previously made commits. 

---

<br/>



### 24. **Git Rm/Remove**:

In Git, the term rm stands for remove. It is used to remove individual files or a collection of files. The key function of git rm is to remove tracked files from the Git index. Additionally, it can be used to remove files from both the working directory and staging index.


---

<br/>



### 25. **Stashing**:

Sometimes you want to switch the branches, but you are working on an incomplete part of your current project. You don't want to make a commit of half-done work. Git stashing allows you to do so. The git stash command enables you to switch branch without committing the current branch.



---

<br/>


### 26. **Tag**:
Tags make a point as a specific point in Git history. It is used to mark a commit stage as important. We can tag a commit for future reference. Primarily, it is used to mark a projects initial point like v1.1. There are two types of tags.

- Light-weighted tag
- Annotated tag


---

<br/>




### 27. **Git Ignore**:
In Git, the term ignore used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It doesn't affect the Files that already tracked by Git.

---

<br/>



### 28. **Git Squash**:
In Git, the term squash is used to squash previous commits into one. Git squash is an excellent technique to group-specific changes before forwarding them to others. You can merge several commits into a single commit with the powerful interactive rebase command.

---

<br/>



### 29. **Origin**:
In Git, "origin" is a reference to the remote repository from a project was initially cloned. More precisely, it is used instead of that original repository URL to make referencing much easier.


---

<br/>

### 30. **Git Rebase**:
Rebasing is a process to reapply commits on top of another base trip. It is used to apply a sequence of commits from distinct branches into a final commit. It is an alternative of git merge command. It is a linear process of merging.

In Git, the term rebase is referred to as the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is very beneficial and it visualized the process in the environment of a feature branching workflow.

It is good to rebase your branch before merging it.

## **Install and Setup Git**

<details>
  <summary>Install and Setup Git | <b>Click to expand</b></summary>
</br>

Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer. Even if it‚Äôs already installed, it‚Äôs probably a good idea to update to the latest version. You can either install it as a package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.


<br>

### **Mac** üçè
___
Git is actually installed on MacOS, but we'll be reinstalling it so that we'll have the newest version.

<details>
<summary>1. Install Git</summary>
<br/>
There are several ways to install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.

```latex
 git --version
 ```

 If you don‚Äôt have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/mac.

so now install Git choosing all of the default options, Once everything is installed, you should be able to run  ```git``` on the command line. If it displays the usage information, then you're good to go!


or you can install it using **Homebrew**,
Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it, then:

```latex
$ brew install git
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>2. First Time Git Configuration</summary>
</br>
Before you can start using Git, you need to configure it. Run each of the following lines on the command line to make sure everything is set up.

```bash
# sets up Git with your name
git config --global user.name "<Your-Full-Name>"

# sets up Git with your email
git config --global user.email "<your-email-address>"

# makes sure that Git output is colored
git config --global color.ui auto

# displays the original state in a conflict
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

git config --list
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Git & Code Editor setup</summary>
</br>

The last step of configuration is to get Git working with your code editor. Below are three of the most popular code editors. If you use a different editor, then do a quick search on Google for "associate X text editor with Git" (replace the X with the name of your code editor).

Atom Editor Setup

```bash
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

Sublime Text Setup
```bash
git config --global core.editor "'/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w"
```

VSCode Setup
```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
