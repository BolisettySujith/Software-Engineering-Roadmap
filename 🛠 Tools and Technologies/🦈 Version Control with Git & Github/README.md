## What is Git Version Control system & What is Github 😃
---
Version control system is an incredibly important part of a professional developer's life. and in this guide, you'll learn about the benefits of version control system and install add Git and Github to your tool belt 😉!

But aside from all of that Git is a free [open source](https://github.com/git/git) software written by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) who also wrote the Linux operating system's kernel. Git is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in programming as version control. If you've used a track changes feature in a text editing software then you're already familiar with the concept!

## Version control models: Centralized vs. Decentralized
---
There are a number of Version Control Systems out there. This alone should prove that version control is incredibly important. Three of the most popular version control systems are:

- Git
- Subversion
- Mercurial

and there are many version control systems out there. Often they are divided into two groups: “centralized” and “distributed”.

### **Centralized**:

Centralized version control systems are based on the idea that there is a single “central” copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server), and developers will “commit” their changes to this central copy.
### **Decentralized**:

In the past five years or so a new breed of tools has appeared: so-called “distributed” version control systems (DVCS for short). The three most popular of these are Mercurial, Git and Bazaar.

These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead, every developer “clones” a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This copy (or “clone”) has all of the metadata of the original.

This method may sound wasteful, but in practice, it’s not a problem. Most programming projects consist mostly of plain text files (and maybe a few images), and disk space is so cheap that storing many copies of a file doesn’t create a noticable dent in a hard drive’s free space. Modern systems also compress the files to use even less space.

<br/>

> **Recap**: 
> Version control systems aim to solve a specific problem that developers face: “storing and sharing multiple versions of code files.” If you’re a developer of any kind and you don’t use any kind of version control, you should start right now. It will make your life easier, so the main point of a version control system is to help you maintain a detailed history of the project as well as the ability to work on different versions of it. Having a detailed history of a project is important because it lets you see the progress of the project over time. If needed, you can also jump back to any point in the project to recover data or files.
